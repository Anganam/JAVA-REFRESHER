# Lesson 2: Create and use for loops including the enhanced for loop


## 2.1 Understanding the simple use of the for loop


## 2.2 Understanding the initialization section of the for loop

Allowed to init vatialnles of the same type in the loop
for(int x = 0, y = 100, z;<test>; <next-time>)



for(int x = 0, y = 100, z, a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4},b[][], c = new int[5];<test>; <next-time>)

Not Allowed: using differernt types
for(int x = 0, float y = 99.9F;<test>; <next-time>)
